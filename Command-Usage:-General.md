* You use `/lpv` instead of `/lp` when running the plugin on Velocity
* Required arguments are marked with angle brackets - e.g. `<required>`
* Optional arguments are marked with square brackets - e.g. `[optional]`
* If you want to include spaces in arguments, you must escape the argument with quotes - e.g. `"  "`

___
#### `/lp`  
**Permission**: n/a  
Base LuckPerms command. Will print a list of the LuckPerms commands a user has permission to use, with brief information about what each command does, and what arguments it accepts.  

___
#### `/lp sync`  
**Permission**: luckperms.sync  
Performs a refresh of all currently loaded data. If any changes have been made to the data in the storage, this command will update the copy on the server to include those changes. 

___
#### `/lp info`  
**Permission**: luckperms.info  
Lists some information/data about LuckPerms, including debugging output, statistics, settings, and important values from the configuration. 

___
#### `/lp editor`  
**Permission**: luckperms.editor  
**Arguments**:  
* `[type]` - the types to include in the editor session. can be "all", "users" or "groups"

Opens a web interface to edit permissions data. After changes are saved, a command will be given that you need to run for the changes to take effect.

___
#### `/lp debug`  
**Permission**: luckperms.debug  
Records debugging output and provides you with a link.

___
#### `/lp verbose`  
**Permission**: luckperms.verbose  
**Arguments**:  
* `<on|record|off|upload>` - whether to enable/disable logging, or to upload the logged output
* `[filter]` - the filter to sort the output

Controls the LuckPerms verbose logging system. This allows you to listen for all permission checks against players on the server. Whenever a permission is checked by a plugin, the check is passed onto the verbose handler.    

If your filters match the permission check, you will be notified.    

`on` will enable the system, and will send you an alert in chat when the filter is matched. `record` will do the same, however you will not be notified of checks in the chat. `off` will simply disable the checking, and `upload` will upload the first results to the web viewer, and provide you with a link.    

Filters match the start of permissions or the user being checked. You can use `&` (and) and `|` (or) symbols, and `!` to negate a match. Parenthesis `( )` are also supported.   

**For example:**    
* `Luck & (essentials | worldedit)` - matches any checks made against my user starting with "essentials" or "worldedit"
* `!Luck & !anticheat` - matches any checks not against my user and not starting with "anticheat"
* `anticheat & !anticheat.check` - matches any checks starting with "anticheat" but not starting with "anticheat.check"

___
#### `/lp tree`

**Arguments**:

* `[player]` - the name of an online player to check against

Generates a tree view of permissions registered to the server. The tree is built using data exposed to the server by plugins, and expanded over time as plugins check for permissions.

All arguments are optional. The default selection is `.` (just a dot, which means all).

Scope allows you to only generate a part of the tree. For example, a scope of `luckperms.user` will only return the branch of the tree starting with "luckperms.user".
