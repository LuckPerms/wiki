* You use `/lpv` instead of `/lp` when running the plugin on Velocity
* Required arguments are marked with angle brackets - e.g. `<required>`
* Optional arguments are marked with square brackets - e.g. `[optional]`
* If you want to include spaces in arguments, you must escape the argument with quotes - e.g. `"  "`

___
#### `/lp`  
**Permission**: n/a  
Base LuckPerms command. Will print a list of the LuckPerms commands a user has permission to use, with brief information about what each command does, and what arguments it accepts.  

___
#### `/lp sync`  
**Permission**: luckperms.sync  
Performs a refresh of all currently loaded data. If any changes have been made to the data in the storage, this command will update the copy on the server to include those changes. 

___
#### `/lp info`  
**Permission**: luckperms.info  
Lists some information/data about LuckPerms, including debugging output, statistics, settings, and important values from the configuration. 

___
#### `/lp editor [type] [filter]`  
**Permission**: luckperms.editor  
**Arguments**:  
* `[type]` - the types to include in the editor session. can be "all", "users", "online" or "groups"
* `[filter]` - if the session includes users (e.g. type = "all", "users" or "online"), it will exclude those whose nodes don't start with the provided filter. Groups are unaffected by this filter

Opens a web interface to edit permissions data. After changes are saved, a command will be given that you need to run for the changes to take effect.

___
#### `/lp verbose <on|record|off|upload> [filter]`  
**Permission**: luckperms.verbose  
**Arguments**:  
* `<on|record|off|upload>` - whether to enable/disable logging, or to upload the logged output
* `[filter]` - the filter to sort the output

Controls the LuckPerms verbose logging system. This allows you to listen for all permission checks against players on the server. Whenever a permission is checked by a plugin, the check is passed onto the verbose handler.    

If your filters match the permission check, you will be notified.    

`on` will enable the system, and will send you an alert in chat when the filter is matched. `record` will do the same, however you will not be notified of checks in the chat. `off` will simply disable the checking, and `upload` will upload the first results to the web viewer, and provide you with a link.    

Filters match the start of permissions or the user being checked. You can use `&` (and) and `|` (or) symbols, and `!` to negate a match. Parenthesis `( )` are also supported.   

**For example:**    
* `Luck & (essentials | worldedit)` - matches any checks made against my user starting with "essentials" or "worldedit"
* `!Luck & !anticheat` - matches any checks not against my user and not starting with "anticheat"
* `anticheat & !anticheat.check` - matches any checks starting with "anticheat" but not starting with "anticheat.check"    
     
More information can be found [**here**](Verbose)

___
#### `/lp tree [scope] [player]`  
**Permission**: luckperms.tree  
**Arguments**:  
* `[scope]` - the root of the tree (specify `.` to include all permissions)
* `[player]` - the name of an online player to check against

Generates a tree view of permissions registered to the server. The tree is built using data exposed to the server by plugins, and expanded over time as plugins check for permissions.

All arguments are optional. The default selection is `.` (just a dot, which means all).

Scope allows you to only generate a part of the tree. For example, a scope of `luckperms.user` will only return the branch of the tree starting with "luckperms.user".

___
#### `/lp search [comparison] <permission>`  
**Permission**: luckperms.search  
**Arguments**:  
* `[comparison]` - the relation between the search and the results

|------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `==`       | "Equal to"      | Default comparator - returns permissions equal to the `<permission>` searched. |
| `!=`       | "Not Equal to"  | Returns permissions not equal to the `<permission>` searched.                  |
| `~~`       | "Similar to"    | Returns permissions 'similar' to the `<permission>` searched. (SQL Style)      |
| `!~`       | "Not Similar to | Returns permissions 'not similar' to the `<permission>` searched. (SQL Style)  |

* `<permission>` - the permission to search for

Searches all users/groups for a specific permission, and returns a paginated list of all found entries. 

___
#### `/lp check <user> <permission>`  
**Permission**: luckperms.check  
**Arguments**:  
* `<user>` - the user to check
* `<permission>` - the permission to check for

Performs a standard permission check on an online player, and returns the result. This check is equivalent to the checks performed by other plugins when checking for permissions.

___
#### `/lp networksync`  
**Permission**: luckperms.sync

#### `/lp import <file|code --upload> [--replace]`  
**Permission**: luckperms.import  
**Arguments**:  
* `<file>` - the file to import from
* `<code> --upload` - the code to web-import from
* `[--replace]` - if included, will overwrite and replace the existing permissions with the import. If not, they will merge.


Imports data into LuckPerms from a file or from the web. If a file, it must be a JSON GZIP type file, exported from Luckperms v5. If from the web, the code must be generated when exporting with the `--upload` flag. The file is expected to be in the plugin directory. When importing a file, the extension `.json.gz` should be included in the name of the import file. When importing a file or web-export, the `--replace` flag may be added to the end of the command to overwrite and replace the existing permissions setup. If the `--replace` flag is not included, the existing permissions setup will be merged with the imported one.

___
#### `/lp export <file|--upload>`  
**Permission**: luckperms.export  
**Arguments**:  
* `<file>` - the file to export to
* `<--upload>` - if added, will export to the web and provide a code for web-based imports.
* `[--without-users]` - if added, will export only all the group data. The export will not include any user data.
* `[--without-groups]` - if added, will export only all the user data. The export will not include any group data.

Exports data from LuckPerms into a file or into web-based datastorage. This file can either be used as a backup, or used to move data between LuckPerms installations. The web-based export will expire and should not be used as a backup. The file and the web-based export can be re-imported using the import command. The generated file will be in the plugin directory.

___
#### `/lp reloadconfig`  
**Permission**: luckperms.reloadconfig
