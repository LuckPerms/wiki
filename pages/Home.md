Hello! :wave:

Welcome to the LuckPerms wiki. Here you will find a complete set of documentation for the plugin, outlining how to install, setup, configure and effectively use LuckPerms.

### Where to start?
If you've never used a permissions plugin before, I suggest you just start at the top and work your way down!

The basics of permissions are covered in detail in the [Getting Started](Usage) page.

A more to the point command reference can be found in the [Command Usage](Command-Usage) subpages.

### How to get help

Support for the project is provided on [Discord](https://discord.gg/luckperms).

We would appreciate it if you try to look for an answer to your question here on the wiki first. It saves us having to repeatedly answer the same questions!

In particular, check the [FAQ](FAQ) page and the "How To" section. ðŸ™‚

### How to report bugs

Bug reports live on [GitHub](https://github.com/lucko/LuckPerms/issues).

You'll need to create a GitHub account, then open a new "issue".

Before reporting a bug, please make sure it is actually being caused by or related to LuckPerms. We get a lot of reports which are caused by other things - please double check! If you're unsure, feel free to ask us in Discord *before* making a report.
