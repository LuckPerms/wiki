Even been in a situation where you need to find a permission for a certain command or feature, but can't find any documentation for it?

Maybe the documentation is outdated, or just doesn't contain the right info. Perhaps you want to debug an issue with players not having the right permissions, or are just interested in what plugins are checking for.

The verbose system allows you to monitor permission checks occurring in real time! ðŸ˜„ 

## How to use it
The command usage is as follows:

### `/lp verbose <on/record|off/upload> [filter]`
The first argument enables/disables the system, and the second sets up the filter.

| Option   | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `on`     | Enables the system, and will send you an alert in chat when the filter is matched. |
| `record` | Same as "on", however you will not be notified via chat. |
| `off`    | Just disables the system, and clears any matches from memory. |
| `upload`  | Same as "off", but will upload the results to the web viewer for easier analysis, and provide you with a link. |

### `/lp verbose command <name> <command>` functionality:

The `/lp verbose command` command allows you to check the permissions of a specific command in-game without any chat-spam or web viewer. To use it, you simply run `/lp verbose command <name> <command>` and LuckPerms will run a couple of steps very quickly.

1. It will turn on verbose for the user in question, using the filter for that user.
2. It will force them to run the command you specify.
3. It will turn verbose off.

This sequence of rapid events will result in the permissions that were checked appearing in chat, without the usual spam. This is especially useful if you need to find permissions for a command that is not well documented.

This command will sudo the user, effectively forcing them to run the command as themselves. As a result, there are additional permissions required to use this functionality. You can find them [on the permissions page](https://github.com/lucko/LuckPerms/wiki/Permissions). While they are included under the `luckperms.*` wildcard permission, they are not included in the regular verbose permission.

##### Client lags when verbose is turned on?
If your client lags when you run `/lp verbose on`, it is likely because there are too many permission checks being processed and the client can't handle that many messages. It is often best to run `lp verbose record` instead. The `record` command will send the permission checks to the web-based verbose viewer, instead of to your client as a chat message. To finish recording permission checks and open the web viewer, simply run `lp verbose upload`.

Alternatively, or in addition to using the online viewer, you can define a filter, explained below.

#### Filters
The filter is an expression used to match permission entries, and ignore entries you don't need. It could just be a player name, or much more advanced.

A filter string will match the start of the permission being checked, or the users full name. You can use `&` (and), `|` (or), and `!` (not / negate) to setup expressions. Parenthesis `(  )` are also supported.

##### Some examples
* `Luck & (essentials | worldedit)` - Matches any checks made against "Luck" that start with "essentials" or "worldedit"
* `Luck & !anticheat` - Matches any checks made against "Luck" that do not start with "anticheat"
* `anticheat & !anticheat.check` - Matches checks on all users starting with "anticheat" but not starting with "anticheat.check"

## Web viewer
The web viewer exposes the same information available in-game, but is easier to analyse when there are lots of checks being processed.
